    "We are not rich by what we possess but by what we can do without.",
    "He who is cruel to animals becomes hard also in his dealings with men. We can judge the heart of a man by his treatment of animals.",
    "Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end.",
    "Enlightenment is man's release from his self-incurred tutelage. Tutelage is man's inability to make use of his understanding without direction from another. Self-incurred is this tutelage when its cause lies not in lack of reason but in lack of resolution and courage to use it without direction from another. Sapere aude! 'Have courage to use your own reason!'- that is the motto of enlightenment.",
    "One who makes himself a worm cannot complain afterwards if people step on him.",
    "Two things fill the mind with ever-increasing wonder and awe, the more often and the more intensely the mind of thought is drawn to them: the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me.",
    "I had to deny knowledge in order to make room for faith.",
    "All our knowledge begins with the senses, proceeds then to the understanding, and ends with reason. There is nothing higher than reason.",
    "Two things fill the mind with ever new and increasing admiration and awe, the more often and steadily we reflect upon them: the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me. I do not seek or conjecture either of them as if they were veiled obscurities or extravagances beyond the horizon of my vision; I see them before me and connect them immediately with the consciousness of my existence.",
    "For peace to reign on Earth, humans must evolve into new beings who have learned to see the whole first.",
    "Whereas the beautiful is limited, the sublime is limitless, so that the mind in the presence of the sublime, attempting to imagine what it cannot, has pain in the failure but pleasure in contemplating the immensity of the attempt",
    "Seek not the favor of the multitude; it is seldom got by honest and lawful means. But seek the testimony of few; and number not voices, but weigh them.",
    "Out of the crooked timber of humanity, no straight thing was ever made.",
    "Rules for happiness: something to do, someone to love, something to hope for.",
    "The busier we are, the more acutely we feel that we live, the more conscious we are of life.",
    "Laziness and cowardice are the reasons why so great a portion of mankind, after nature has long since discharged them from external direction (naturaliter maiorennes), nevertheless remains under lifelong tutelage, and why it is so easy for others to set themselves up as their guardians. It is so easy not to be of age. If I have a book which understands for me, a pastor who has a conscience for me, a physician who decides my diet, and so forth, I need not trouble myself. I need not think, if I can only pay - others will easily undertake the irksome work for me.\nThat the step to competence is held to be very dangerous by the far greater portion of mankind...",
    "Genius is the ability to independently arrive at and understand concepts that would normally have to be taught by another person.",
    "The death of dogma is the birth of morality.",
    "But only he who, himself enlightened, is not afraid of shadows.",
    "Space and time are the framework within which the mind is constrained to construct its experience of reality.",
    "Thoughts without content are empty, intuitions without concepts are blind.",
    "Have patience awhile; slanders are not long-lived. Truth is the child of time; erelong she shall appear to vindicate thee.",
    "...new prejudices will serve as well as old ones to harness the great unthinking masses.\n\nFor this enlightenment, however, nothing is required but freedom, and indeed the most harmless among all the things to which this term can properly be applied. It is the freedom to make public use of one's reason at every point. But I hear on all sides, 'Do not argue!' The Officer says: 'Do not argue but drill!' The tax collector: 'Do not argue but pay!' The cleric: 'Do not argue but believe!' Only one prince in the world says, 'Argue as much as you will, and about what you will, but obey!' Everywhere there is restriction on freedom.",
    "A categorical imperative would be one which represented an action as objectively necessary in itself, without reference to any other purpose.",
    "Act that your principle of action might safely be made a law for the whole world.",
    "Two things awe me most, the starry sky above me and the moral law within me.",
    "Seek not the favor of the multitude; it is seldom got by honest and lawful means. But seek the testimony of few; and number, not voices, but weigh them.",
    "The only objects of practical reason are therefore those of good and evil. For by the former is meant an object necessarily desired according to a principle of reason; by the latter one necessarily shunned, also according to a principle of reason.",
    "Immaturity is the incapacity to use one’s intelligence without the guidance of another.",
    "Morality is not the doctrine of how we may make ourselves happy, but how we may make ourselves worthy of happiness.",
