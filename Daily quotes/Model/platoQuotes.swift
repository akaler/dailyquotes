    "The beginning is the most important part of the work.",

    "Sons, the event proves that your fathers were brave men; for we might have lived dishonourably, but have preferred to die honourably rather than bring you and your children into disgrace, and rather than dishonour our own fathers and forefathers",
    "Wise men talk because they have something to say; fools, because they have to say something",
    "One of the penalties for refusing to participate in politics is that you end up being governed by your inferiors.",
    "People are like dirt. They can either nourish you and help you grow as a person or they can stunt your growth and make you wilt and die.",
    "There are two things a person should never be angry at: What they can help, and what they cannot.",
    "Do not train a child to learn by force or harshness; but direct them to it by what amuses their minds, so that you may be better able to discover with accuracy the peculiar bent of the genius of each.",
    "I am the wisest man alive, for I know one thing, and that is that I know nothing.",
    "Never discourage anyone...who continually makes progress, no matter how slow.",
    "The measure of a man is what he does with power.",
    "There are three classes of men; lovers of wisdom, lovers of honor, and lovers of gain.",

    "To be afraid of death is only another form of thinking that one is wise when one is not; it is to think that one knows what one does not know. No one knows with regard to death whether it is not really the greatest blessing that can happen to man; but people dread it as though they were certain it is the greatest evil. Either we shall find what it is we are seeking or at least we shall free ourselves from the persuasion that we know what we do not know.",
    "Knowledge which is acquired under compulsion has no hold on the mind. Therefore do not use compulsion, but let early education be a sort of amusement; you will then be better able to discover the child's natural bent.",
    "False words are not only evil in themselves, but they infect the soul with evil.",
    "In practice people who study philosophy too long become very odd birds, not to say thoroughly vicious; while even those who are the best of them are reduced by...[philosophy] to complete uselessness as members of society.",
