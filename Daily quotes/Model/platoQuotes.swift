    var quotes : [String] = ["Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a harder battle.","Every heart sings a song, incomplete, until another heart whispers back. Those who wish to sing always find a song. At the touch of a lover, everyone becomes a poet","Wise men speak because they have something to say; fools because they have to say something","We can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark; the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light","The heaviest penalty for declining to rule is to be ruled by someone inferior to yourself","I am the wisest man alive, for I know one thing, and that is that I know nothing","Never discourage anyone...who continually makes progress, no matter how slow","One of the penalties of refusing to participate in politics is that you end up being governed by your inferiors", "Good people do not need laws to tell them to act responsibly, while bad people will find a way around the laws", "The man who finds that in the course of his life he has done a lot of wrong often wakes up at night in terror, like a child with a nightmare, and his life is full of foreboding: but the man who is conscious of no wrongdoing is filled with cheerfulness and hope."]
