    var quotes : [String] = ["If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle. ",
    "All warfare is based on deception. Hence, when we are able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must appear inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near.",
    "Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win",
    "If your enemy is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, evade him. If your opponent is temperamental, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant. If he is taking his ease, give him no rest. If his forces are united, separate them. If sovereign and subject are in accord, put division between them. Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected.",
    "Engage people with what they expect; it is what they are able to discern and confirms their projections. It settles them into predictable patterns of response, occupying their minds while you wait for the extraordinary moment — that which they cannot anticipate.",
    "Thus we may know that there are five essentials for victory:\n1 He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight.\n2 He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces.\n3 He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its ranks.\n4 He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared.\n5 He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign.",
    "Treat your men as you would your own beloved sons. And they will follow you into the deepest valley.",
    "Be extremely subtle even to the point of formlessness. Be extremely mysterious even to the point of soundlessness. Thereby you can be the director of the opponent's fate.",
    "When strong, avoid them. If of high morale, depress them. Seem humble to fill them with conceit. If at ease, exhaust them. If united, separate them. Attack their weaknesses. Emerge to their surprise.",
    "One mark of a great soldier is that he fight on his own terms or fights not at all.",
    "If the mind is willing, the flesh could go on and on without many things.",
    "Anger may in time change to gladness; vexation may be succeeded by content.\nBut a kingdom that has once been destroyed can never come again into being; nor can the dead ever be brought back to life.",
    "Attack is the secret of defense; defense is the planning of an attack.",
    "When one treats people with benevolence, justice, and righteoousness, and reposes confidence in them, the army will be united in mind and all will be happy to serve their leaders'.",
    "Bravery without forethought, causes a man to fight blindly and desperately like a mad bull.  Such an opponent, must not be encountered with brute force, but may be lured into an ambush and slain.",
    "The general who advances without coveting fame and retreats without fearing disgrace, whose only thought is to protect his country and do good service for his sovereign, is the jewel of the kingdom.",
    "Move not unless you see an advantage; use not your troops unless there is something to be gained; fight not unless the position is critical.",
    "The skillful tactician may be likened to the shuai-jan. Now the shuai-jan is a snake that is found in the Ch'ang mountains. Strike at its head, and you will be attacked by its tail; strike at its tail, and you will be attacked by its head; strike at its middle, and you will be attacked by head and tail both.",
    "Water shapes its course according to the nature of the ground\nover which it flows; the soldier works out his victory in relation \nto the foe whom he is facing.",
    "If words of command are not clear and distinct, if orders are not thoroughly understood, then the general is to blame. But, if orders are clear and the soldiers nevertheless disobey, then it is the fault of their oficers.",
    "It is only the enlightened ruler and the wise general who will use the highest intelligence of the army for the purposes of spying, and thereby they achieve great results.",
    "There are five dangerous faults which may affect a general: \n(1) Recklessness, which leads to destruction; \n(2) cowardice, which leads to capture; \n(3) a hasty temper, which can be provoked by insults;\n (4) a delicacy of honor which is sensitive to shame; \n(5) over-solicitude for his men, which exposes him to worry and trouble.",
    "Hence a commander who advances without any thought of winning personal fame and withdraws in spite of certain punishment, whose only concern is to protect his people and promote the interests of his ruler, is the nation's treasure. Because he fusses over his men as if they were infants, they will accompany him into the deepest valleys; because he fusses over his men as if they were his own beloved sons, they will die by his side. If he is generous with them and yet they do not do as he tells them, if he loves them and yet they do not obey his commands, if he is so undisciplined with them that he cannot bring them into proper order, they will be like spoiled children who can be put to no good use at all.",
    "In battle, there are not more than two methods of attack--the \ndirect and the indirect; yet these two in combination give rise to \nan endless series of maneuvers.",
    "When your army has crossed the border, you should burn your boats and bridges, in order to make it clear to everybody that you have no hankering after home.",
    "Those skilled at making the enemy move do so by creating a situation to which he must conform; they entice him with something he is certain to take, and with lures of ostensible profit they await him in strength.",
    "Hence that general is skilful in attack whose opponent does not know what to defend; and he is skilful in defense whose opponent does not know what to attack.",
    "Conceal your dispositions, and your condition will remain secret, which leads to victory;  show your dispositions, and your condition will become patent, which leads to defeat.",
    "The end and aim of spying in all its five varieties is knowledge of the enemy; and this knowledge can only be derived, in the first instance, from the converted spy. Hence it is essential that the converted spy be treated with the utmost liberality.",
    "The spot where we intend to fight must not be made known; for then the enemy will have to prepare against a possible attack at several different points.",
