    "Finish each day and be done with it. You have done what you could. Some blunders and absurdities no doubt crept in; forget them as soon as you can. Tomorrow is a new day. You shall begin it serenely and with too high a spirit to be encumbered with your old nonsense.",

Peace has its victories, but it takes brave men and women to win them.",
    "Once you make a decision, the universe conspires to make it happen.",
