    "The reading of all good books is indeed like a conversation with the noblest men of past centuries who were the authors of them, nay a carefully studied conversation, in which they reveal to us none but the best of their thoughts",
    "If you would be a real seeker after truth, it is necessary that at least once in your life you doubt, as far as possible, all things.",
    "I suppose therefore that all things I see are illusions; I believe that nothing has ever existed of everything my lying memory tells me. I think I have no senses. I believe that body, shape, extension, motion, location are functions. What is there then that can be taken as true? Perhaps only this one thing, that nothing at all is certain.",
    "Conquer yourself rather than the world.",
    "Common sense is the most widely shared commodity in the world, for every man is convinced that he is well supplied with it.",
    "Doubt is the origin of wisdom",
    "It is not enough to have a good mind; the main thing is to use it well.",
    "Except our own thoughts, there is nothing absolutely in our power.",
    "And thus, the actions of life often not allowing any delay, it is a truth very certain that, when it is not in our power to determine the most true opinions we ought to follow the most probable.",
    "To know what people really think, pay attention to what they do, rather than what they say.",
    "The greatest minds are capable of the greatest vices as well as of the greatest virtues.",
    "I desire to live in peace and to continue the life I have begun under the motto 'to live well you must live unseen",
    "Dubito, ergo cogito, ergo sum.\n(English: I doubt, therefore I think, therefore I am)",
    "It is only prudent never to place complete confidence in that by which we have even once been deceived.",
    "You just keep pushing. You just keep pushing. I made every mistake that could be made. But I just kept pushing.",
    "To live without philosophizing is in truth the same as keeping the eyes closed without attempting to open them.",
    "In order to seek truth, it is necessary once in the course of our life to doubt, as far as possible, of all things.",
    "There is nothing more ancient than the truth.",
    "Divide each difficulty into as many parts as is feasible and necessary to resolve it.",
    "Each problem that I solved became a rule which served afterwards to solve other problems",
    "At last I will devote myself sincerely and without reservation to the general demolition of my opinions.",
    " I cannot forget that, at other times I have been deceived in sleep by similar illusions; and, attentively considering those cases, I perceive so clearly that there exist no certain marks by which the state of waking can ever be distinguished from sleep, that I feel greatly astonished; and in amazement I almost persuade myself that I am now dreaming.",
    "My third maxim was to endeavor always to conquer myself rather than fortune, and change my desires rather than the order of the world, and in general, accustom myself to the persuasion that, except our own thoughts, there is nothing absolutely in our power; so that when we have done our best in things external to us, all wherein we fail of success is to be held, as regards us, absolutely impossible: and this single principle seemed to me sufficient to prevent me from desiring for the future anything which I could not obtain, and thus render me contented",
    "But what then am I? A thing that thinks. What is that? A thing that doubts, understand, affirms, denies, wills, refuses, and that also imagines and senses.",
    "I am thing that thinks: that is, a things that doubts,affirms, denies, understands a few things, is ignorant of many things, is willing, is unwilling, and also which imagines and has sensory perceptions.",
    "[...] the diversity of our opinions, consequently, does not arise from some being endowed with a larger share of reason than others, but solely from this, that we conduct our thoughts along different ways, and do not fix our attention on the same objects. For to be possessed of a vigorous mind is not enough; the prime requisite is rightly to apply it. The greatest minds, as they are capable of the highest excellences, are open likewise to the greatest aberrations; and those who travel very slowly may yet make far greater progress, provided they keep always to the straight road, than those who, while they run, forsake it.",

    "The two operations of our understanding, intuition and deduction, on which alone we have said we must rely in the acquisition of knowledge.",
    "I hope that posterity will judge me kindly, not only as to the things which I have explained, but also to those which I have intentionally omitted so as to leave to others the pleasure of discovery.",
    "Like a prisoner who dreams that he is free, starts to suspect that it is merely a dream, and wants to go on dreaming rather than waking up, so I am content to slide back into my old opinions; I fear being shaken out of them because I am afraid that my peaceful sleep may be followed by hard labor when I wake, and that I shall have to struggle not in the light but in the imprisoning darkness of the problems I have raised.",
