    ["If anyone tells you that a certain person speaks ill of you, do not make excuses about what is said of you but answer, 'He was ignorant of my other faults, else he would not have mentioned these alone.'",
    "There is only one way to happiness and that is to cease worrying about things which are beyond the power or our will.",
    "Man is not worried by real problems so much as by his imagined anxieties about real problems",
    "Don't just say you have read books. Show that through them you have learned to think better, to be a more discriminating and reflective person. Books are the training weights of the mind. They are very helpful, but it would be a bad mistake to suppose that one has made progress simply by having internalized their contents.",
    "First say to yourself what you would be;\nand then do what you have to do.",
    "How long are you going to wait before you demand the best for yourself and in no instance bypass the discriminations of reason?\nYou have been given the principles that you ought to endorse, and you have endorsed them. What kind of teacher, then, are you still waiting for in order to refer your self-improvement to him? You are no longer a boy, but a full-grown man.\nIf you are careless and lazy now and keep putting things off and always deferring the day after which you will attend to yourself, you will not notice that you are making no progress, but you will live and die as someone quite ordinary.\nFrom now on, then, resolve to live as a grown-up who is making progress, and make whatever you think best a law that you never set aside.\nAnd whenever you encounter anything that is difficult or pleasurable, or highly or lowly regarded, remember that the contest is now: you are at the Olympic Games, you cannot wait any longer, and that your progress is wrecked or preserved by a single day and a single event.\nThat is how Socrates fulfilled himself by attending to nothing except reason in everything he encountered. And you, although you are not yet a Socrates, should live as someone who at least wants to be a Socrates.",
    "Any person capable of angering you becomes your master;\nhe can anger you only when you permit yourself to be disturbed by him.",
    "The key is to keep company only with people who uplift you, whose presence calls forth your best.",
    "He who laughs at himself never runs out of things to laugh at.",
    "Freedom is the only worthy goal in life. It is won by disregarding things that lie beyond our control.",
    "It is impossible for a man to learn what he thinks he already knows.",
    "Circumstances don't make the man, they only reveal him to himself.",
    "Other people's views and troubles can be contagious. Don't sabotage yourself by unwittingly adopting negative, unproductive attitudes through your associations with others.",
    "People are not disturbed by things, but by the views they take of them.",
    "To accuse others for one's own misfortune is a sign of want of education. To accuse oneself shows that one's education has begun. To accuse neither oneself nor others shows that one's education is complete.",
    "I laugh at those who think they can damage me. They do not know who I am, they do not know what I think, they cannot even touch the things which are really mine and with which I live.",
    "First learn the meaning of what you say, and then speak.",
    "No man is free who is not master of himself.",
    "Attach yourself to what is spiritually superior, regardless of what other people think or do. Hold to your true aspirations no matter what is going on around you.",
    "Seek not the good in external things;seek it in yourselves.",
    "Remember, it is not enough to be hit or insulted to be harmed, you must believe that you are being harmed. If someone succeeds in provoking you, realize that your mind is complicit in the provocation. Which is why it is essential that we not respond impulsively to impressions; take a moment before reacting, and you will find it easier to maintain control.",
    "The greater the difficulty, the more glory in surmounting it. Skillful pilots gain their reputation from storms and tempests.",
    "Caretake this moment. Immerse yourself in its particulars. Respond to this person, this challenge, this deed. Quit evasions. Stop giving yourself needless trouble. It is time to really live; to fully inhabit the situation you happen to be in now.",
    "Don't seek to have events happen as you wish, but wish them to happen as they do happen, and all will be well with you.",
    "Do not try to seem wise to others.",
    "It is better to die of hunger having lived without grief and fear, than to live with a troubled spirit, amid abundance",
    "These reasonings are unconnected: 'I am richer than you, therefore I am better'; 'I am more eloquent than you, therefore I am better.' The connection is rather this: 'I am richer than you, therefore my property is greater than yours;' 'I am more eloquent than you, therefore my style is better than yours.' But you, after all, are neither property nor style.",
    "Either God wants to abolish evil, and cannot; or he can, but does not want to.",
    "Appearances to the mind are of four kinds. Things either are what they appear to be; or they neither are, nor appear to be; or they are, and do not appear to be; or they are not, and yet appear to be. Rightly to aim in all these cases is the wise man's task.",
    "You become what you give your attention to.",
    "Even as the Sun doth not wait for prayers and incantations to\nrise, but shines forth and is welcomed by all: so thou also wait\nnot for clapping of hands and shouts and praise to do thy duty;\nnay, do good of thine own accord, and thou wilt be loved like the Sun.",
