    "I learned this, at least, by my experiment: that if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours.",
    "How vain it is to sit down to write when you have not stood up to live.",
    "It’s not what you look at that matters, it’s what you see.",
    "You must live in the present, launch yourself on every wave, find your eternity in each moment. Fools stand on their island of opportunities and look toward another land. There is no other land; there is no other life but this.",
    "Do not be too moral. You may cheat yourself out of much life so. Aim above morality. Be not simply good, be good for something.",
    "Pursue some path, however narrow and crooked, in which you can walk with love and reverence.",
    "If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away.",
    "Many men go fishing all of their lives without knowing that it is not fish they are after.",
    "You cannot dream yourself into a character: you must hammer and forge yourself into one.",
    "I do believe in simplicity. It is astonishing as well as sad, how many trivial affairs even the wisest thinks he must attend to in a day; how singular an affair he thinks he must omit. When the mathematician would solve a difficult problem, he first frees the equation of all incumbrances, and reduces it to its simplest terms. So simplify the problem of life, distinguish the necessary and the real. Probe the earth to see where your main roots run.",
    "Public opinion is a weak tyrant compared with our own private opinion. what a man thinks of himself, that it is which determines, or rather indicates, his fate.",
    "I have never found a companion that was so companionable as solitude.",
    "The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation.",
    "A truly good book teaches me better than to read it. I must soon lay it down, and commence living on its hint. What I began by reading, I must finish by acting.",
    "Every generation laughs at the old fashions, but follows religiously the new.",
    "There is no remedy for love, but to love more.",
    "However mean your life is, meet it and live it.",
    "We must walk consciously only part way toward our goal and then leap in the dark to our success.",
    "Any fool can make a rule, and any fool will mind it.",
    "As a single footstep will not make a path on the earth, so a single thought will not make a pathway in the mind. To make a deep physical path, we walk again and again. To make a deep mental path, we must think over and over the kind of thoughts we wish to dominate our lives.",
    "I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by a conscious endeavour. It is something to be able to paint a particular picture, or to carve a statue, and so to make a few objects beautiful; but it is far more glorious to carve and paint the very atmosphere and medium through which we look, which morally we can do. To affect the quality of the day, that is the highest of arts.",
