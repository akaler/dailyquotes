    [
    "True happiness is to enjoy the present, without anxious dependence upon the future, not to amuse ourselves with either hopes or fears but to rest satisfied with what we have, which is sufficient, for he that is so wants nothing. The greatest blessings of mankind are within us and within our reach. A wise man is content with his lot, whatever it may be, without wishing for what he has not.",
    "Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.",
    "All cruelty springs from weakness.",
    "Religion is regarded by the common people as true, by the wise as false, and by rulers as useful.",
    "'Non est ad astra mollis e terris via' - 'There is no easy way from the earth to the stars'",
    "Difficulties strengthen the mind, as labor does the body.",
    "We suffer more often in imagination than in reality",
    "You act like mortals in all that you fear, and like immortals in all that you desire",
    "The time will come when diligent research over long periods will bring to light things which now lie hidden. A single lifetime, even though entirely devoted to the sky, would not be enough for the investigation of so vast a subject... And so this knowledge will be unfolded only through long successive ages. There will come a time when our descendants will be amazed that we did not know things that are so plain to them... Many discoveries are reserved for ages still to come, when memory of us will have been effaced.",
    "If a man knows not to which port he sails, no wind is favorable.",
    "It is the power of the mind to be unconquerable.",
    "Begin at once to live, and count each separate day as a separate life.",
    "If you really want to escape the things that harass you, what you’re needing is not to be in a different place but to be a different person.",
    "Until we have begun to go without them, we fail to realize how unnecessary many things are. We've been using them not because we needed them but because we had them.",
    "They lose the day in expectation of the night, and the night in fear of the dawn.",
    "Putting things off is the biggest waste of life: it snatches away each day as it comes, and denies us the present by promising the future. The greatest obstacle to living is expectancy, which hangs upon tomorrow, and loses today. You are arranging what lies in Fortune's control, and abandoning what lies in yours. What are you looking at? To what goal are you straining? The whole future lies in uncertainty: live immediately.",
    "Most powerful is he who has himself in his own power.",
    "Wealth is the slave of a wise man. The master of a fool",
    "For what prevents us from saying that the happy life is to have a mind that is free, lofty, fearless and steadfast - a mind that is placed beyond the reach of fear, beyond the reach of desire, that counts virtue the only good, baseness the only evil, and all else but a worthless mass of things, which come and go without increasing or diminishing the highest good, and neither subtract any part from the happy life nor add any part to it?\nA man thus grounded must, whether he wills or not, necessarily be attended by constant cheerfulness and a joy that is deep and issues from deep within, since he finds delight in his own resources, and desires no joys greater than his inner joys.",
    "If you live in harmony with nature you will never be poor; if you live according what others think, you will never be rich.",
    "People are frugal in guarding their personal property; but as soon as it comes to squandering time they are most wasteful of the one thing in which it is right to be stingy.",
    "Fate leads the willing and drags along the reluctant.",
    "A sword never kills anybody; it is a tool in the killer's hand.",
    "Leisure without books is death, and burial of a man alive.",
    "We should every night call ourselves to an account;\nWhat infirmity have I mastered today?\nWhat passions opposed? What temptation resisted? What virtue acquired? Our vices will abort of themselves if they be brought every day to the shrift.",
    "We are always complaining that our days are few, and acting as though there would be no end of them.",
    "It is not because things are difficult that we do not dare; it is because we do not dare that things are difficult.",
    "Associate with people who are likely to improve you.",
    "You want to live but do you know how to live? You are scared of dying and tell me, is the kind of life you lead really any different from being dead?",
    "Anger, if not restrained, is frequently more hurtful to us than the injury that provokes it.",
    "errare humanum est, sed perseverare diabolicum: 'to err is human, but to persist (in the mistake) is diabolical.",
    "Withdraw into yourself, as far as you can. Associate with those who will make a better man of you. Welcome those whom you yourself can improve. The process is mutual; for men learn while they teach.",
    "You live as if you were destined to live forever, no thought of your frailty ever enters your head, of how much time has already gone by you take no heed. You squander time as if you drew from a full and abundant supply, though all the while that day which you bestow on some person or thing is perhaps your last.",]
