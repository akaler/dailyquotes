iOS app to deliver daily quotes
This code was written by Abhijot Kaler to deliver daily quotes from famous philosophers to users. User's can customize the app to suite their preferences. 
I created custom classes to customize Apple's inbuilt UI elements to create a unique user experience. Each page of the app is written in *ViewController.Swift files.
The app is optimized to work on all screen sizes apple offeres on iPhones and iPads.
